# Online Bank Statements App

A simple polymer component to show list of transaction for specific account

A small assignment in Polymer JS using frontend html, css. You can find the aim of the assignment
in images folder, file name- polymerassignment.jpg, After learning this new technology I implemented my best 
practice with unit test.

Why I have chosen this particular piece of code?
Because, itâ€™s the best JavaScript library when it comes to Progressive Web Apps and lazy loading. I don't want
to write n-number of lines of code(Angularjs reusable custom directive) for simple things, which is already
implemented in polymer elements, Its like just develop your components and reuse it. I worked more on angularjs but find polymerjs better.

## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. 
Then run `polymer install` for the first time to load all dependent modules 
and Then run `polymer serve` to serve your element locally.

## Viewing Your Element

```
$ polymer install

$ polymer serve --open
```

## Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```

Your application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `polymer test` to run your application's test suite locally.
